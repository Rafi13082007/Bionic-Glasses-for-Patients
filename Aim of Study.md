Research quantitative data (slow wave sleep, REM, light sleep and awake) and qualitative data 

 

1. **Sleep Stages**: 

   - **REM Sleep**: Time spent in Rapid Eye Movement sleep, which is associated with dreaming and cognitive processing. 

   - **NREM Sleep**: Time spent in Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep, including light sleep (stages 1 and 2) and deep sleep (stages 3 and 4), which is crucial for physical restoration. 

 

2. **Sleep Duration**: 

   - Total amount of sleep per night, usually measured in hours. 

 

3. **Sleep Efficiency**: 

   - Percentage of time spent asleep while in bed, calculated as (total sleep time/time in bed) x 100. 

 

4. **Sleep Latency**: 

   - The amount of time it takes to fall asleep after going to bed. 

 

5. **Awakenings**: 

   - Frequency and duration of awakenings during the night. 

 

6. **Heart Rate**: 

   - Average heart rate and heart rate variability during sleep, which can indicate sleep stages and overall sleep quality. 

 

7. **Respiratory Rate**: 

   - Number of breaths per minute during sleep, important for identifying potential sleep disorders like sleep apnea. 

 

8. **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**: 

   - Levels of oxygen in the blood during sleep, critical for detecting respiratory issues. 

 

9. **Body Movement**: 

   - Amount and frequency of movement during sleep, which can indicate restlessness or disturbances. 

 

10. **Body Temperature**: 

    - Core body temperature changes during sleep, which can influence sleep quality. 

 

Measure: 

 

1. **Polysomnography (PSG)**: 

   - A comprehensive sleep study conducted in a lab setting that measures brain activity (EEG), eye movements (EOG), muscle activity (EMG), heart rate (ECG), respiratory function, and more. 

 

2. **Actigraphy**: 

   - Wearable devices (such as wristbands) that monitor movement and provide estimates of sleep duration and efficiency. 

 

3. **Wearable Fitness Trackers and Smartwatches**: 

   - Devices that measure heart rate, movement, and sometimes SpO2 and body temperature to provide insights into sleep stages and quality. 

 

4. **Home Sleep Apnea Tests (HSATs)**: 

   - Portable devices used to diagnose sleep apnea that measure respiratory parameters, oxygen levels, and heart rate. 

 

5. **Smartphone Apps and Bedside Devices**: 

   - Applications and devices that use microphones, accelerometers, and other sensors to track sleep patterns and provide biometric data.
