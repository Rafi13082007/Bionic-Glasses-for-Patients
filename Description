WHOOP for old people. 

We are making a pair of glasses which allow for remote monitoring of dementia patients. This is through: a heart rate sensor, speaker, battery all integrated into a glasses frame. We need everything to be able to connect to wifi, and we need an app where a remote carer can track heart rate, call the patient and set reminders.
