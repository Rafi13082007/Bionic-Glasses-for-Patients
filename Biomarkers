Several biomarkers for dementia can be non-invasively and continuously measured using advanced technologies. Here are some examples: 

### Ocular Biomarkers: 

1. **Retinal Imaging**: Retinal scans can detect changes in the retina that correlate with dementia. Techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) can measure retinal thickness and identify amyloid plaques, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease . 

2. **Pupillometry**: Changes in pupillary response to light can be indicative of cognitive decline. Studies have shown that the pupillary light reflex can reflect cholinergic system dysfunction, which is common in Alzheimer's disease .
