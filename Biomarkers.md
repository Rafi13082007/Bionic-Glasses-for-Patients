Several biomarkers for dementia can be non-invasively and continuously measured using advanced technologies. Here are some examples: 

### Ocular Biomarkers: 

1. **Retinal Imaging**: Retinal scans can detect changes in the retina that correlate with dementia. Techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) can measure retinal thickness and identify amyloid plaques, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease . 

2. **Pupillometry**: Changes in pupillary response to light can be indicative of cognitive decline. Studies have shown that the pupillary light reflex can reflect cholinergic system dysfunction, which is common in Alzheimer's disease . 

### Wearable and Portable Biomarkers: 

3. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: Reduced HRV has been associated with increased risk of dementia. Wearable devices like smartwatches can continuously monitor HRV, providing insights into autonomic nervous system function . 

4. **Sleep Patterns**: Abnormal sleep patterns and disturbances are linked to cognitive decline. Devices like the Oura Ring and smartwatches can track sleep stages and quality, offering valuable data on sleep-related biomarkers  . 

5. **Gait Analysis**: Changes in gait and motor function can prec ede cognitive symptoms in dementia. Wearable sensors and smartphone apps can monitor walking patterns and detect early signs of motor impairment .
